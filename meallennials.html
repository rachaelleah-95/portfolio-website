                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                 <p>Cooking at home is becoming more of a rarity with the convenience of fast food and the busy schedule most people have day-to-day. After a long day, the last thing anyone wants to do is figure out a healthy meal to eat, shop for groceries, and then spend the rest of their evening cooking.
                 </p>
             </div>
             <div>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                 <p>A responsive web app where users will be able to make grocery shopping more convenient by allowing them to manage their grocery list and place a pickup or delivery order. In addition to this, users will be able to save, organize, and share their favorite recipes.

                    A qualitative analysis was conducted by interviewing three people ranging from ages 25-32 to learn more about how they typically find new recipes and how often they try to cook at home. After these interviews, I had a clearer picture of some frustrations the participants had as well as some of the needs they were looking for.

                <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do you typically find new recipes?</li>
                    <li>What features are most useful to you on a recipe website?</li>
                    <li>What features would be most relevant to you when searching for recipes?</li>
                    <li>Can you think of any features that would entice you to use a specific recipe app?</li>

                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>None of the participants used any specific website or app dedicated to finding recipes.</li>
                    <li>All want convenience.</li>
                    <li>Consistent frustration was websites that have a blogging aspect to them.</li>
                    <li>Need for handling their ingredients/shopping more conveniently.</li>
                    <li>An all-in-one app to handle grocery lists and grocery ordering.</li>

                    Once I learned more about the interviewed participants, I had a better idea of what their needs might be. This helped me create a user flow with three key functionalities that included saving a recipe, adding ingredients to a grocery list, and sharing recipes with friends.

                    With this app, I decided to jump in immediately with mid-fidelity wireframes. This gave me a good starting point with a few ideas I had, but the overall design changed significantly once I started working on the high-fidelity wireframes.

                    When creating a mood board for this app, I became drawn to the colors of the citrus fruits; I wanted something that felt fresh, modern, and youthful. This is ultimately what inspired my final color palette. The bright colors are found in many ingredients and are associated with fresh, delicious food. My decision to use red as the primary color was because research shows that red is eye-catching and triggers appetite.

                    From the UX Research portion to the UI Design, I learned a great deal throughout this project. I realized how important it is to not get set on one idea and to be more open to creating a variety of different mood boards. The original idea you have may not be the “end all, be all” and it’s important to be open to trying new things and be more adventurous.  
                </p>
                <p>When it came to the UI Design portion of creating this app, I learned that I need to spend more time on my low and mid-fidelity wireframes. I have a really hard time creating the layout and design of the app before adding color, typography, images, etc.. I spend a lot of time redoing the layout when I am adding those visual aspects and I need to learn to make the layout more complete in those mid-fidelity wireframes first.
